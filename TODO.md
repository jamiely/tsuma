1. Tests
2. When balls reach the hole, you have to start the board over.
3.  ðŸŸ¡ Replicate boards from Zuma (completed world 1)
4.  Bug when pushing/matching ball that falls into sink.
5.  Start the level over when you lose.
6.  mobile support, specifically landscape mode, hide panel,
    use full screen.
7.  ~~There is some bug clearing a match where the match happens right before the tail. Might happen after a magnetic. The tail will also get erroneously cleared.~~
8.  When you use the backwards power-up, and balls go past the first waypoint, they get removed from the game. We should push these balls onto a queue to become the next spawned balls to provide continuity.
9.  Display text on the board including game over, board name, and when you start over, x lives left.
10. Make accuracy ball graphic a triangle. Make it collide with the nearest ball.
11. ~~It's possible for an effect to persist even after it is removed from the game.effects array. Change how these effects are stored.~~
12. bug where you get stuck when the balls go into the sink, everything seems to freeze.
13. ~~Somehow launched a black ball.~~ addressed this by ensuring there is always some color (not undefined);
14. Create a disconnected section by clearing matches on either end. Now pull that segment using magnetic. The segment's balls will stretch out a bit for a few pixels but otherwise won't move. The magnetic will not apply.
15. When explosion removed an accuracy ball, accuracy effect was not applied.
16. After a backwards ball was applied, all the balls went away and no new balls were spawned. In the console, I just see "no previous waypoint available". Eventually I saw board over "lost".
17. Shot a ball near the tail and saw `TODO isCollidingWithPreviousBall true`. Handle this. After this happened, it seemed like the tail did not move, while the head moved alone. When I cleared the head, then the tail moved. What probably happened is that the tail somehow went ahead of the head.
18. Tried to clear 2 blue balls in 1-5. I hit the tail (I think), then one of the balls kept going backwards indefinitely, and I hit `console.error("Do not remove a ball in this method");` The ball was removed after it went too far backwards, and the other 2 blue balls resumed continuing forward. Possibly insertion exceeded some threshold?
