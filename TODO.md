1. Tests
2. ~~When there is a match, should the chain split into two
   chains? Visually they look different, but it may be easier
   to leave the chain as 1 and adjust how matching works, which
   currently doesn't take into account distance.~~
4. When there is a gap in a chain, there are two cases. If
   the balls on each end match in color, then pull the more
   forward chain back onto the other chain.
5. If the balls do not match color, the backmost chain should
   continue forward until it comes into contact with the next
   chain, then start to push it.
