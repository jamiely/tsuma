1. Tests
2. When there is a gap in a chain, if
   the balls on each end match in color, then pull the more
   forward chain back onto the other chain, as if they are
   magnetically attracted.
3. When balls reach the hole, you have to start the board over.
4. When balls reach the hole, flush all of the balls into the
   hole by increasing the speed a lot.
5. Game freezes when chained ball speed is more than 2.
6.  Tail doesn't disappear down hole.
7.  ~~If we are inserting before a ball, never just take the
    position of the ball in front of it in the chain. This is
    because there might be a gap between a ball and the one in
    front due to math.~~
8.  ~~Bug when launching a new ball that hits the tail. The ball
    pushes the entire chain up as it is inserted.~~
